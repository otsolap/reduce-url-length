# Url shortener

## TODO

#1 Go from Material-UI to Bootstrap.

#2 Make the application look intuitive. Make the UX also compatable with mobile.

#3 make the url-post field more obvious for UX's perspective.

#4 make a feedback animation so when the user inputs the url the page refreshes or the output table re-renders itself. Right now the user must refresh manually. Users love feedback, right now your table for example does not update when submitting more links. Loading indicators etc go a long way as well.

#5 Make the reduced-urls the actual urls. Right now the application just utulizes the naming conventions, but the link has not been truly created.

#6 clean-the-project up folder and file-wise.

#8 use async/await instead of .get().then(), it will make your code cleaner in the long run

#9 Read up on building a service structure into your React project. For example build a service which fetches data from the backend instead of having the components do it.

#10 Sanitize or even slightly check what comes from your inputs especially in the backend
